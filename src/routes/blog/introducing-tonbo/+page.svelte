				<p class="text-[0.75rem] mb-[1rem]">August 14, 2024 by Tzu Gwo</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				We’re excited to announce that <a href="https://github.com/tonbo-io/tonbo" class="underline"
					>Tonbo</a
				> is now open source in its preview version! Tonbo is an embedded persistent database written
				in Rust. It provides essential KV-like methods: insert, filter, and range scan, making it a foundation
				for data-intensive applications, including other types of databases. It also supports type-safe
				structured data storage. For Rust developers, we offer an ORM-like macro for ease of use:
			</p>
			<CodeBlock
				language="rust"
				{code}
				showHeader={false}
				showLineNumbers={true}
				background="bg-background-dark"
				codeTextClasses="font-code text-background-light text-[0.8rem]"
				lineNumberTextClasses="font-code text-background-light"
				rounded="rounded-none"
			/>
			<p />
			<p class="mt-[2rem]">
				Tonbo enables fast and convenient querying over type-safe structured data. For example,
				integrating a query engine takes just a few hours of coding: <a
					href="https://github.com/tonbo-io/tonbo/blob/main/examples/datafusion.rs"
					class="underline">datafusion example</a
				>
				(official support for DataFusion will be included in the next release). In our preliminary benchmarks,
				Tonbo outperforms RocksDB by 2.2x in data scan scenarios, even though it's still in its early
				stages. If you’re interested in Tonbo, please star the project on GitHub, follow us on
				<a href="https://x.com/tonboio" class="underline">Twitter</a>, or join the conversation on
				<a href="https://discord.gg/xa2KyKV5" class="underline">Discord</a>.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-[1.2rem] font-medium mt-[1.2rem]">Why We Built Tonbo?</h2>
			<p>
				Analytical tools in the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/" class="underline"
					>Apache Arrow</a
				>
				ecosystem (such as
				<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion" class="underline"
					>Apache Arrow DataFusion</a
				>) provide a nice foundation for data processing. They get a great balance between
				scalability, development efficiency, and execution performance, allowing developers to build
				efficient data analysis applications within days using DataFusion.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-[1rem]">
				However, most tools focus on the read path of databases. Every data-intensive
				application using DataFusion ends up spending significant time developing its own write path
				implementation. What if we could have a write path implementation as agile and performant as
				DataFusion?
			</p>
			<p class="mt-[1rem]">
				That’s the primary design goal of Tonbo: to serve as an embedded database offering a highly
				scalable data storage engine for the Arrow ecosystem. Additionally, Tonbo also has a
				long-term goal: <b class="font-medium"
					>provide offline-first distributed data storage capabilities, support rapid and flexible
					data storage across various environments—from embedded Linux and browsers to servers—and
					integrate with multiple storage systems such as file systems, OPFS, and S3.</b

			<h2 class="text-[1.2rem] font-medium mt-[1.2rem]">How is Tonbo Designed?</h2>
			<h3 class="text-[1.1rem] font-medium mt-[1.1rem]">LSM Tree</h3>
			<p>
				Tonbo is built on the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree"
					class="underline">LSM Tree</a
				>
				architecture. Typically, databases use either
				<a href="https://tikv.org/deep-dive/key-value-engine/b-tree-vs-lsm/" class="underline"
					>Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees or B+ trees</a
				>. The primary advantage of LSM trees is that all foreground writes are performed in memory,
				while background writes are sequential, resulting in very high write throughput.
			</p>

			<p>
				LSM trees also have minimal file system requirements: they only need a file system that
				supports append-only operations to achieve high-performance data insertion and updates. This
				makes Tonbo suitable for a wide range of devices, from flash storage to SSDs. By offloading
				tasks like data clean-up and compaction to the background, LSM trees streamline the
				read/write process and reduce the load on the frontend.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-[1.1rem] font-medium mt-[1.1rem]">Type-Safe Structured Storage</h3>
			<p>
				As mentioned earlier, Tonbo extends beyond a traditional KV database to support reading and
				writing structured data. This capability is achieved by faithfully translating user-defined
				data structures into Arrow schemas. Tonbo leverages the features provided by Arrow/Parquet
				to support pushdown operations like limit, project, and filter:
			</p>
			<Structured />
			<p class="mt-[2rem]">
				This means that Tonbo can precisely scan the data specified by the user, skipping
				irrelevant data, leading to potentially more than tenfold improvements in querying
				efficiency when used appropriately. Additionally, according to compile-time type hints, Tonbo
				can transmute bytes read from files into user-defined data types for free. In many
				data-intensive applications, serialization overhead can account for 30% to 50% of the total
				load.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-[1.1rem] font-medium mt-[1.1rem]">Asynchronous</h3>
			<p>Tonbo fully supports asynchronous methods:</p>
			<Aschronous />
			<p class="mt-[2rem]">
				Using asynchronous interfaces not only increases the efficiency of concurrent operations,
				but also allows Tonbo to provide concurrent access on resource-constrained devices, such as
				browsers, mobile apps, and embedded Linux systems. The LSM Tree architecture, as mentioned
				in previous sections, requires background tasks for garbage collection and compaction of newly
				written data, which can be challenging to implement in browsers since they cannot easily
				start background tasks. By leveraging WASM and async Rust interfaces, we can build a
				complete asynchronous task chain from OPFS to the JavaScript scheduler. In our upcoming blog
				posts, we will describe in detail how we achieve this—bear witness!

			<p>As we prepare for our next release, we plan to introduce several new features:</p>
			<pre
				class="break-words whitespace-pre-wrap font-code text-background-dark">	• Runtime Schema Declaration: Basic support for JavaScript (WASM) and Python.</pre>

			<p class="mt-[1rem]">
				We will soon offer a unified solution for both self-hosted and cloud environments, enabling
				the creation of offline-first storage and backup services on any remote storage platform.
				Designs and implementations are only valuable with real-world usage and feedback. If you
